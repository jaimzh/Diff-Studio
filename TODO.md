# Diff Studio TODO

## UI Stuff

- [x] Resizable Panel Constraints: Add constraints to panels so they show buttons when shrunk to a particular size (LeetCode style).
<!-- - [ ] Arrangable Windows: Implement a flexible window management system similar to LeetCode's multi-panel layout. -->
- [x] Notes or txt in language support instead of a panel 
- [x] Excalidraw Panel: Integrate Excalidraw for sketching and diagramming.
- [ ] Replace or try a new modern icon library 
- [ ] Complete UI rebranding and make it look more premium, even make my own custom logo to match diff studio
- [ ] Update favicon 
- [ ] find a way to hide or make the regular and pro chat toggle subtle 
- [x] fix the buttons for the constraint on panel 2
- [x] fix unnecessary imports in app.jsx that is stopping deployment 
- [x] Conditionally render the seperator so it only shows when it is ewll expanded but the moment it is collapsed the hg color is transperent 
- [ ] find a way to fix the ai pro chat let it have more space or like dynamic sizind when chat in in order so it has more space 
`
## AI & Intelligence

- [ ] Proper AI Handling: Enhance AI integration for better code analysis, diff generation, and chat responses.
- [ ] AI Context Awareness: Ensure AI has context of all panels (notes, diagrams, code).....maybeeeee

## Other

- [ 1/2] Refine Aesthetics: Continue polishing the premium look and feel.

## Infrastructure & Platform stuff, complex stuff to handle later...more like future works 

- [ ] Next.js Migration: Translate the project from Vite/React to Next.js.
- [ ] Authentication: Implement secure user login.
- [ ] Database Integration: Set up a database to persist user notes, diagrams, and settings.
