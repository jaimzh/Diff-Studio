# Diff Studio TODO

## UI Stuff

- [x] Resizable Panel Constraints: Add constraints to panels so they show buttons when shrunk to a particular size (LeetCode style).
- [ ] Arrangable Windows: Implement a flexible window management system similar to LeetCode's multi-panel layout.
- [x] Notes or txt in language support instead of a panel 
- [x] Excalidraw Panel: Integrate Excalidraw for sketching and diagramming.
- [ ] fix the buttons for the constraint on panel 2
- [ ] fix unnecessary imports in app.jsx that is stopping deployment 
- [ ] Conditionally render the scrollbar so it only shows when it is ewll expanded but the moment it is collapsed the hg color is transperent

## AI & Intelligence

- [ ] Proper AI Handling: Enhance AI integration for better code analysis, diff generation, and chat responses.
- [ ] AI Context Awareness: Ensure AI has context of all panels (notes, diagrams, code).....maybeeeee

## Other

- [ ] Refine Aesthetics: Continue polishing the premium look and feel.

## Infrastructure & Platform stuff, complex stuff to handle later

- [ ] Next.js Migration: Translate the project from Vite/React to Next.js.
- [ ] Authentication: Implement secure user login.
- [ ] Database Integration: Set up a database to persist user notes, diagrams, and settings.
